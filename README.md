# Instagram-Bot
This is a repository where we will be creating an Instagram bot using the [Instagrapi](https://pypi.org/project/instagrapi/) module. This is very easy to build and indeed something many might want to use in their everyday life such as myself who's intended to solve personal real world problems with projects such as this.

Commands used from the [Instagrapi GitHub](https://pypi.org/project/instagrapi/).

What is this particular project all about, since there are multiple use cases to a Instagram Bot?
1. This code checks for a particular post in under your account
2. Surfs through the comments and checks for a particular word in those comments, such as "gib" in this case.
3. Then it sends a DM to those who have commented "gib" with a pre-ready message with related links, etc. promoting my portfolio and such and such.
